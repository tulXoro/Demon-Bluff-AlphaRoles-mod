# Demon Bluff - Alpha Roles

## Description

Mod for the game [Demon Bluff](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3522600/Demon_Bluff/). It reintroduces roles that were cut or unimplemented, while trying to maintain the vanilla feel of the game. Because the game is still in early development, I'm not sure if I'll maintain this.
